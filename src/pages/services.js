            <p>
              Aluminum Associates provides professional installation services
              for those customers who want the security of knowing that their
              project has been completed to the highest standards, and the work
              is guaranteed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Installation Manager takes the time to recheck all site
              measurements before the product is ordered, so that the person
              responsible for the installation is involved at an early stage. In
              this way we have a smooth transition from sales, to ordering, to
              installation – ensuring the product is installed to the customer`s
              complete satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unique to Aluminum Associates, our custom designed installation
              trucks have been laid out to provide the highest level of
              efficiency while on the job site. These 16` cube vans are fully
              equipped workshops on wheels at your doorstep
