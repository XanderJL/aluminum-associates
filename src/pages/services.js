          <p>
            Aluminum Associates provides professional installation services for
            those customers who want the security of knowing that their project
            has been completed to the highest standards, and the work is
            guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Installation Manager takes the time to recheck all site
            measurements before the product is ordered, so that the person
            responsible for the installation is involved at an early stage. In
            this way we have a smooth transition from sales, to ordering, to
            installation – ensuring the product is installed to the customer`s
            complete satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unique to Aluminum Associates, our custom designed installation
            trucks have been laid out to provide the highest level of efficiency
            while on the job site. These 16` cube vans are fully equipped
            workshops on wheels at your doorstep
