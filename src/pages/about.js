                Aluminum Associates, founded in 1963, is a leading provider of
                exterior home improvement products and services in the London
                area – and has been for over five decades!
              </p>
              <p>
                Its founders, Jim and Betty Low, began operations from their
                back porch and expanded the company by extending their family
                values of honesty, accountability, dedication, and caring to
                each and every business transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, their son, Ian, is at the helm and Aluminum Associates
                continues to thrive. Every new undertaking is more than just
                another job – it`s an opportunity for Ian to honour his parent`s
                legacy by practicing the values he was raised with.

            <p>
              "Aluminum Associates started with a simple business philosophy –
              provide quality products at reasonable prices with customer
              service and satisfaction as our first priority. Today, over five
              decades later, this philosophy is still in practice – it`s the
              code by which we operate and the key to our success."

            <p>
              Our business continues to thrive because we demonstrate, on a
              daily basis, that we value the same things our customers do. Easy
              for us to say perhaps, but our customers say the same thing – see
              the Testimonials page to see what they`ve said.

            <h2 className="title is-size-2">Our Values</h2>
            <p>
              Honesty - We offer fair pricing and no-pressure sales; everything
              is as straightforward as possible, and we put it in writing to
              ensure that the details are clearly understood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Integrity - We sell only quality products that are backed with
              solid warranties – as is our installation service. Our installers
              demonstrate professional workmanship – the same workmanship they
              would use on their own homes. Our customers receive written
              assurances of quality products and installation, giving them peace
              of mind for the years ahead.
            </p>

            <p>
              Respect - Our customers are always treated with courtesy, their
              questions and concerns are handled with compassion, and their
              property treated with great care.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dedication - Our knowledgeable, skilled staff is dedicated to
              serving the needs of our customers – they demonstrate this through
              their attention to detail and the pride they have in their work.
              Our employees get a great deal of pleasure from helping customers
              find the product they`re searching for, or completing an
              installation that makes an improvement in a customer`s home.
            </p>

            <p>
              Professionalism - Our company vehicles are kept clean and in good
              working order, and our staff wear uniforms so that customers can
              easily identify them as members of our qualified team. Our staff
              receive thorough training and supervision to ensure quality of
              service and workmanship is always maintained.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most of our customers come to us as a result of referrals from
              friends or neighbours of customers who have experienced the values
              that Aluminum Associates operates by. We operate our business with
              every intention of being here to serve you, our customers, for
              decades to come.

            <h2 className="title is-size-2">Our Community</h2>
            <p>
              The work that we do beautifies the homes and neighbourhoods in our
              community. We take pride in knowing that we also take the steps
              needed to ensure that we keep our community beautiful by recycling
              as much waste from our office, warehouse and job sites as
              possible. At Aluminum Associates we have a number of large
              recycling bins on our property where we collect waste aluminum,
              vinyl, and cardboard. These, along with used doors and windows,
              are directed to recycling depots where they will be used to create
              a variety of post-consumer products, rather than filling up our
              city`s landfill. Our actions demonstrate our dedication to take
              the steps necessary to protect our environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Serving London and area since 1963, we have always believed that
              it is both a pleasure and a responsibility to give back to the
              community in which we live and work. Each year Aluminum Associates
              donates to local community groups, especially those that offer
              opportunities for young children to participate in sports, or for
              women and children in crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company provides employment for more than 25 employees who
              subsequently provide for their families. We also supply products
              to a large number of contractors who make their living in the
              exterior home improvement industry. Together, we make a
              significant contribution to the economy of our community.
