              What Should I Look For When Buying A New Entry Door?
            </h2>
            <p>
              There are hundreds of options available when it comes to selecting
              an entrance system. Of course the size of the opening and your
              budget will be key factors, but there are a large number of options
              available to help you get exactly what you need and want. These
              include: configuration (single door, or door with side lite, for
              example), material, size, shape of decorative panels, type of glass
              (if any), finish, weatherstripping, cladding, sill type, jamb depth,
              and hardware. Some choices will be determined by the size of your
              opening, but your Aluminum Associates sales representative will
              discuss your options and help you to select the right product for
              your application, but here are a few points to help you narrow down
              your choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Premium steel doors are energy efficient, maintenance free, and
              everlasting. Wooden doors are not. They are often drafty, far less
              secure, require regular maintenance, and are prone to deterioration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fiberglass doors are specially engineered to provide maximum
              protection and durability. They will not dent; and resist splitting,
              cracking and warping. Available in both a smooth or woodgrain
              texture, they are also paintable and stainable, providing years of
              low maintenance satisfaction. The deep wood-grain texture yields a
              very realistic wood-like appearance in a much more durable material.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lites (the glass area in a door or sidelite) come in a number of
              sizes, decorative styles, glass types, and caming options (the
              divider between glass pieces, as in a leaded glass panel). They let
              light in, and in some cases, allow ventilation. Glass lites can
              provide varying degrees of privacy depending on the type of glass
              used (clear, glue chip, bevelled , etc.) and the complexity of the
              design. Some lites are also available with shades or blinds that are
              sealed between the panes of glass where the need for dusting is
              eliminated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Door lites consist of two panes of tempered glass (which is 4 to 5
              times stronger than standard glass), and if they are of a more
              decorative nature, often triple panes – breaking through would not
              be easy so you can feel secure, even with a large door lite.
              Deadbolt locks are recommended for the best security.
            </p>
            <p>
              With so many options it`s easy to find the right product for your
              home. See the Doors page of this website for information about the
              specific features of the quality doors that Aluminum Associates
              sells and installs.

              What Is The Difference Between Replacement And Retrofit Windows?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Installation of a replacement window involves removal of existing
              sashes and screens, and fitting the new window inside the existing
              wood frame or jamb. To make your windows maintenance free any
              exterior exposed wood is covered using aluminum cladding. This
              method is used for approximately 95% of all window installations
              into existing openings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Retrofit (sometimes called full frame replacement) involves not only
              the removal of your current sashes and screens, but also removal of
              the existing wood jamb, going right back to the rough stud opening.
              This is considered the top of the line installation method. Retrofit
              does cost a little more, but the benefits make it worth considering.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a typical replacement window the glass area is reduced. A
              retrofit installation, however, maximizes your glass area because
              the existing jamb is removed. Removing the jamb also gives the
              opportunity to address problems of insufficient insulation and wood
              rot. At Aluminum Associates, this process is also used when an
              overall structural change is being made, such as the replacement of
              a small window with a much larger one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aluminum Associates has perfected the retrofit procedure and we use
              only top quality products and methods. Unlike others who perform
              retrofit installations without benefit of a new wood jamb, or only a
              small jamb extension, we always use a one-piece wrap-around wood
              jamb, thereby enhancing structural integrity. We do not recommend
              using vinyl, or a combination of wood and vinyl, jamb extensions –
              when we secure the casing trim around your new window we want to be
              sure the nail hits wood, not a thin layer of vinyl.

              What Other Factors Should I Consider Before Purchasing New Windows?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Windows not only impact the appearance of your home, they also
              provide natural lighting, ventilation, and can be a means of
              emergency escape. If your windows are more than 15 years old they
              may be in need of replacement.
            </p>
            <p>
              WHY : You should consider replacing your windows if you are
              experiencing water leakage or drafts due to deterioration. Newer
              high performance windows offer significant improvement in energy
              efficiency, solar control, and thermal comfort. Vinyl windows also
              eliminate the regular painting that is required to keep wood windows
              looking good.
            </p>
            <p>
              WHEN : Contrary to public perception, window installation can be
              completed year-round. In most cases, the length of time between
              removal of the old window and replacement with a new one is a matter
              of minutes. There is no need to delay installation until spring or
              summer; waiting will only postpone the added comfort and energy
              savings that you could be enjoying immediately after your new
              windows are installed.
            </p>
            <p>
              WHAT : There are 2 window types: fixed (non-opening) and operable
              (opening). Among the operable units there are several styles:
              awning, casement, horizontal slider, vertical slider (single or
              double hung), single tilt and tilt. Operating features, benefits,
              cost, and location feasibility, vary according to style.
            </p>
            <p>
              WHERE : When deciding on the suitability of window types and styles
              for your window locations there are a number of factors to consider.
              While fixed windows are less expensive and ensure the highest degree
              of security and air tightness, their use may be dictated by safety
              code restrictions. The type of window currently in place also
              determines, in part, the appropriate window replacement.
            </p>
            <p>
              WHO : Advancements in window technology make installation somewhat
              more complex than it was in the past. Expert installation, complete
              with an installation warranty, is your wisest choice. At Aluminum
              Associates we guarantee our products, our workmanship, and your
              satisfaction.
            </p>

              What Is Low E And Argon, And How Does It Reduce Energy Costs?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Heat naturally flows to areas of low temperature. In fact, during
              the heating season up to two-thirds of the heat in your home can be
              lost through standard window glass. This heat transfer can be
              countered with a micro thin, metallic, low emittance (Low E) coating
              between the two panes of window glass. Emittance refers to the
              relative power of a surface to emit heat by radiation. If there is a
              heat source inside (or outside) your house, the Low E coating on the
              glass bounces much of the heat that radiates from that object back
              away from the window.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in the winter months the heat that is generated by your
              furnace, or is given off by objects that have been warmed (such as
              walls or furniture), naturally tries to flow toward the cooler air
              outside via your windows, but much of it can be bounced back into
              your room by the Low E coating. In the summer, the reverse is true.
              Outside, the sun heats the air, the driveway, the brick on your
              neighbours house, etc., and this heat radiates and tries to get into
              your house through your windows. The Low E glass coating, however,
              bounces much of it back outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              Argon gas is a colourless, odorless, non-toxic, non-flammable and
              non-corrosive gas used to insulate the dead air space normally found
              between two panes of glass. It resists the transfer of heat through
              the space and has an insulation value more than 30% greater than air
              – the overall result is warmer interior glass surfaces of 5 to 6
              degrees in winter, with greater resistance to condensation. Warmer
              interior glass surfaces mean convected downdrafts are reduced, which
              makes sitting areas near windows or patio doors much more
              comfortable, allowing you greater use of your floor space.
            </p>
            <p>
              As glass allows visible light to enter, it also allows ultraviolet
              (UV) radiation in. This causes fading and deterioration of
              carpeting, drapery, and upholstery. Low E and Argon Gas have the
              added advantage of blocking two-thirds of harmful UV rays that cause
              damage, helping to reduce colour fading and extend the lifetime of
              valuable furnishings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your windows have Low E and Argon your furnace and
              air-conditioning systems work less – that can add up to significant
              energy savings on your monthly bills; and your furnishings last
              longer which will also save money in the long term. Your investment
              will have value-added benefits when you include Low E and Argon in
              your window purchase.

              What Do I Need To Know About Eavestrough?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Eavestroughs may be one of the most overlooked and undervalued
              features of your home (until they cease to function effectively!).
              While their impact on appearance is less dramatic than windows,
              siding, or doors, eavestroughs are essential to extending the life
              of your home. The lack of eavestroughs, or poorly installed or
              maintained trough, can promote water seepage into basements, cause
              damage to foundations, and wash away plants, soil and mulch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Available in a wide variety of colours, aluminum eavestrough never
              needs to be painted because the colour is baked right on. Using
              specially equipped trucks, our team members can fabricate the
              desired length of seamless eavestrough onsite. Standard seamless
              eavestrough is 5" in width, and 6" width is also available to handle
              the large volumes of rainwater on larger homes or commercial
              buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
              See the Aluminum products page for specific information about the
              quality aluminum products that we sell and install.
            </p>
            <h3 className="title is-size-4">Installation</h3>
            <p>
              In the past, the common method of installation was to insert spikes
              through the trough and into the fascia. Trough expands and contracts
              over time, however, resulting in the spikes becoming loose and
              eventually falling out. Today, we install all eavestrough using
              hidden brackets and screws, which provide a clean look and keep your
              trough secure. The addition of a leaf screen system (see below) also
              enhances the strength and stability of trough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it requires extra effort and skill, Aluminum Associates
              fabricates hand miters at the corners, rather than using standard
              preformed box miters. This reduces the number of seams from three to
              one, which helps to reduce the potential for leakage. Gutter Seal is
              used to seal joints, instead of silicone, because it is more pliable
              and has better adhesion, resulting in a seal that lasts longer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The placement and number of downspouts required varies from
              application to application. A number of factors are taken into
              consideration, however, including the slope or fall of the land; and
              the location of walkways, basement windows, and any low lying areas.
            </p>
            <h3 className="title is-size-4">Leaf Screen</h3>
            <p>
              Eavestrough should be cleaned twice yearly (particularly when
              overhanging trees are a factor). This can be time consuming, messy,
              and for homeowners not comfortable with working off of ladders, a
              potential hazard. The installation of leaf screen eliminates these
              concerns while adding value to your home. It prevents leaves and
              other debris from entering your eavestrough and allows the water to
              be drained away, even when ice and snow lay on top of the leaf
              screen. It can easily be installed on new or existing eavestrough
              and is maintenance free – you`ll never have to unclog your
              eavestrough again! See the Aluminum products page of this website
              for more information about the leaf screen and eavestrough sold at
              Aluminum Associates.
