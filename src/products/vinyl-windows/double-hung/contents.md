When you're looking for quality, energy-efficient vinyl windows, look no further than Aluminum Associates. Our windows are virtually maintenance free because they're manufactured of 100% solid vinyl. They won't rot, warp, blister or peel, they never need painting, and they're designed for easy cleaning.

Our vinyl windows have been certified under the Canadian Standards Association's International Windows and Doors Certification Program, and carry the CSA mark as your assurance that these windows have met rigid standards. They are also ENERGY STARÂ® qualified and can save you money by reducing your energy costs up to 12 percent. Not only that, they'll help keep your home comfortable all year-round, reduce outside noise, and, depending on the amount of humidity in your home, can significantly reduce condensation in cold weather.

Each vinyl window is custom-built to meet your specific requirements, and their strict attention to detail ensures that you get a beautiful window that is guaranteed to maintain its shape and colour under the most severe conditions.
